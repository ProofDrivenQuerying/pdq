  To install dependencies and requirements:

  On MacOS/Linux, you can download node with Homebrew.

  Otherwise, download [node and npm] (https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) manually or
  with your favorite package manager. After you have node and npm, go to the
  project's root directory and run:

    npm install

  This will automatically install all of the dependencies listed in the app's
  package.json file.

  ## Installing & Running the App

  Visit `pdq/rest` and start the backend. You will get errors in the GUI if it
  runs without a backend.

  Under the top directory, type:

  	npm start

  This runs the app in the development mode.
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


    npm run test

  This launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
  See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

    npm run build

  Builds the app for production to the build folder.
  It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
  The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
  See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
