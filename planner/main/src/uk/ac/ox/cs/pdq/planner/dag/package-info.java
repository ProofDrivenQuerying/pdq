	This package contains classes related to exploring DAG configurations.
	DAG configurations are built up compositionally and can be either unary or binary.
	Unary configurations correspond to single access plans, while binary configurations correspond to join plans. 
	This package also includes a class for transforming DAG configurations to bushy plans.
