PDQ estimate (Lowest adjusted quality):
We approximate this query using the binary annotated plan Binary(Binary(Unary(V10(c25)),Unary(V2(c13,c25))),Unary(V8(c25,c11)))
with Quality: 1.0	Adjusted quality: 2.0
The size estimate with/without histograms is 106076
The actual size of Binary(Binary(Unary(V10(c25)),Unary(V2(c13,c25))),Unary(V8(c25,c11))) is 8557278

PDQ estimate (Lowest size):
We approximate this query using the binary annotated plan  
Binary(Binary(Unary(orders(c25,c26,c27,c28,c17,2-HIGH,c29,c30,c31)),Unary(V2(c13,c25))),Unary(V8(c25,c11))) 
with Quality: 1.0	Adjusted quality: 3.0
The size estimate without histograms is 21221
