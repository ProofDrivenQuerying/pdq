PDQ estimate (Lowest adjusted quality):

We approximate this query using the binary annotated plan Binary(Unary(V8(c1,c4)),Unary(V10(c23,c1)))
The size estimate using histograms is 3212574 
The size estimate without histograms is 1454229
The actual size of Binary(Unary(V8(c1,c4)),Unary(V10(c23,c1))) is 1650155
