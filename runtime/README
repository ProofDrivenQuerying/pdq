This projects also contains schema and relation wrappers, to access underlying
data sources such as RDBMSs and webservices.

The source code is available for free for non-commercial use.
See the LICENCE file for details.

I. Requirements
   
 * Java 1.7 or higher
 * Maven 2 or higher
   You can build each library outside Maven, e.g. in your favorite IDE, but
   you will have to managed dependencies manually.

II. Dependencies
 
Internal: (pdq-)common
External: jcommander-1.35
	
III. Installing & running the runtime

Under the top directory, type:

	mvn install
	
The JAR will be built and placed in the project's "target/" directory under the
name pdq-runtime-<version>.jar.

To run the runtime, type:

	java -jar /path/to/JAR/file --help
	
This will printout all required command line arguments.

Runtime parameters can be passed through the command line, however, you 
may want to set those parameters in a separate file.
See pdq-runtime.properties for an overview of all parameters that can be used.

Example:
	mvn install
	java -jar target/pdq-runtime-<version>.one-jar.jar \
			-c examples/example_01/case.properties     \
			-s examples/example_01/schema.xml          \
			-q examples/example_01/query.xml           \
			-p examples/example_01/plan.xml           \
			-v
