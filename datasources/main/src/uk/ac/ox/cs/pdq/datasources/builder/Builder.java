 * Interface common to builder class.

 * initialize with a single constructor calls, e.g. if many fields are
 * mandatory and many consistency checks are required.
 * The builder class works as a proxy, receiving all necessary initializations
 * on behalf to the object to be created.
 * The final object is actually instantiated upon a call to the build() method.
