Customers from the same country, with URGENT orders. Can exploit order_customer view.

Query:

SELECT c_name, c_name
 FROM orders
  JOIN customer ON o_custkey = c_custkey
  JOIN customer ON c_nationkey = c_nationkey
  JOIN orders ON o_custkey = c_custkey
 WHERE o_orderpriority = '1 - URGENT'
 

Schema:

orders has 9 columns and 1500 rows
customer has 8 columns and 150 rows
