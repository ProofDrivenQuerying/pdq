This test has as input the following query:

SELECT p_name, ps_availqty
 FROM part
  JOIN partsupp ON p_partkey = ps_partkey
  JOIN supplier ON ps_suppkey = s_suppkey
  JOIN nation ON s_nationkey = n_nationkey
  JOIN region ON n_regionkey = r_regionkey
 WHERE r_name = 'AMERICA'

- part has 9 columns and 200 rows
- partsupp has 5 columns and 700 rows
- supplier has 7 columns and 100 rows
- nation has 4 columns and 25 rows
- region has 3 columns and 5 rows

There are constraints:
- from partsupp to supplier
- from partsupp to part
