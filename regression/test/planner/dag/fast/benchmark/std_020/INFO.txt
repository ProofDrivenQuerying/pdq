Comment:

Select from a whole bunch of joins. Rejected confusing comment in query.xml

Query:

SELECT s_name, s_address
 FROM supplier
  JOIN nation ON s_nation = n_nation
  JOIN partsupp ON s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
  JOIN part ON ps_partkey = p_partkey
  JOIN lineitem ON p_partkey = l_partkey
 WHERE l_shipdate = '1998-01-01' AND n_name = 'CHINA' AND p_name = 'goldenrod lavender spring chocolate lace'

Schema:

supplier has 7 columns and 100 rows
nation has 4 columns and 25 rows
partsupp has 5 columns and 700 rows
part has 9 columns and 200 rows
lineitem has 16 columns and 6005 rows
